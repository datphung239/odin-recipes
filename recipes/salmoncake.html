    <h1>Chef John's Fresh Salmon Cake</h1>
    <a href="https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2008/12/1/1/BX0106_Salmon-Cakes.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.406.406.suffix/1620691182999.jpeg"></a>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Salmon cakes are one of my go-to emergency meals. Every once in a while I like to use fresh salmon. Salmon is one of those products, like chicken, that's very easy to get into a rut with. People generally find a few recipes that work for them, and just stay with those, but this fairly simple preparation should be easy to add to anyone's rotation. Serve with lemon wedge and remoulade sauce. You can use any bread crumbs instead of panko breadcrumbs, if desired.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prep Time: 20 mins</li>
        <li>Cook Time: 15 mins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked thick spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound bay scallops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>â…“ cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, divided</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step1</h4>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package.</p>
    <h4>Step2</h4>
    <p>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn.</p>

    <h4>Step4</h4>
    <p>Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute.</p>
    <h4>Step5</h4>
    <p>Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice.    </p>
    <h4>Step6</h4>
    <p>Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute.    </p>
    <h4>Step7</h4>
    <p>Remove from heat. Garnish generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls.    </p>
